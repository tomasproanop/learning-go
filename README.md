# Learning Go

Just to keep track of my learning of Go/Golang during the summer semester 2024. :)

Go is the language we will be using in these semester's Algorithms and Data Structures class. 

Most exercises are from the official [tutorial](https://go.dev/tour). I also recommend to check out the course [Algorithms with Go](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_algo) by Jon Calhoun, which is very helpful.
